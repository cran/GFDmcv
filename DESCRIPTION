Description: Performs test procedures for general hypothesis testing problems for four multivariate coefficients of variation (Ditzhaus and Smaga, 2023 <arXiv:2301.12009>). We can verify the global hypothesis about equality as well as the particular hypotheses defined by contrasts, e.g., we can conduct post hoc tests. We also provide the simultaneous confidence intervals for contrasts.
